provisioning
============

Uncustomized sample installation could be done with this line

```sh
curl -L https://raw.github.com/immutables/provisioning/master/install | bash
```

Customize by exporting special variables:

```sh
# configuration and deployment git repository base
export IM_ORIGIN=https://github.com/immutables
# production branch in configuration repository
export IM_PRESET=production
```

It is highly recommended to create your one single copy-paste command installation with customization.
